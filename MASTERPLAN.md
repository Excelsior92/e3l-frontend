## üß† Conceptual Data Model

### User
- `id`
- `name`
- `email`
- `preferences / goals`
- `chat history`
- `roadmap progress`
- `completed assessments`

### Resource
- `id`
- `title`
- `type` (PDF, video, course, etc.)
- `source` (internal, external)
- `tags` (career, motivation, product mgmt, etc.)
- `link or storage path`

### Assessment
- `id`
- `title`
- `questions` (type: MCQ or AI-led)
- `results / logic`
- `linked recommendations`

### Roadmap
- `id`
- `title`
- `steps`
- `related tags`
- `suggested for` (user goals/states)

## üß™ UI/UX Principles
- Minimal and distraction-free
- Perplexity-style clean layout
- White and blue only color theme
- Fast access to chat and core features
- Feel like a 1-on-1 interaction with a helpful companion
- Immediate value, delayed signup friction

## üîí Security Considerations
